/**
* Class representing the operator that &quot;simplifies&quot; a body or a part of a body.
* &lt;br&gt;
* The simplification operation consists in removing the cells which are not needed 
* for a consistent body topology. 
* &lt;br&gt;
* This operation applies to 3D, 2D and 1D bodies:
* &lt;ul&gt;
* &lt;li&gt;In a solid made up of several cells of CATVolume type, volumes can be merged. The faces between the volumes
* to be simplified are then removed while some faces and edges are merged.
* &lt;li&gt;In a skin made up of several cells of CATFace type, faces can be merged. The edges between the faces
* to be simplified are then removed while some edges are merged.
* &lt;li&gt;In a wire made up of several cells of CATEdge type, edges can be merged.
* The vertices between the edges to be simplified are then removed. 
* &lt;/ul&gt;
* The simplification is achieved as far as the geometric modeler rules are satisfied, for example, the C2 continuity
* criteria must be fulfilled all over the faces to be simplified on a skin.
* &lt;br&gt;The CATICGMTopSimplify operator follows the global frame of the topological operators
* and satisfies the smart mechanism: the
* input bodies are not modified. A new resulting body is created, 
* possibly sharing data with the input bodies.
*&lt;ul&gt;
* &lt;li&gt;A CATICGMTopSimplify operator is created with the &lt;tt&gt;CATCGMCreateTopSimplify&lt;/tt&gt; global function.
* It must be directly released with the &lt;tt&gt;Release&lt;/tt&gt; method after use. 
* It is not streamable. 
*&lt;li&gt;The computation is done by the &lt;tt&gt;Run&lt;/tt&gt; function. 
*&lt;li&gt;The result is accessed with the &lt;tt&gt;GetResult&lt;/tt&gt; method. If you do not want 
* to keep the resulting body, use the @href CATICGMContainer#Remove method to remove it from the 
* geometric container, after the operator deletion.
*&lt;/ul&gt;
*&lt;ul&gt;
* &lt;li&gt;Volumes , faces or edges can be simplified.
* &lt;li&gt;During the simplification, new cells are created to replace several adjacent cells 
* linked to the same or equivalent geometry. For example, if a skin made up of two faces
* relying on the same surface is simplified, a new face replacing the two initial faces is created
* &lt;li&gt;The simplification can only be done between adjacent cells of the same domain
* &lt;li&gt;The simplification of edges bordering faces can only be achieved from a 3D or 2D body whose 
* volumes or faces have already been simplified. This case is unlikely to happen as
* the simplication process operates for the cells of all dimensions in a body.
* &lt;li&gt;To specify which part of the body is to be simplified, you can use either &lt;tt&gt;SetCellsToRemove&lt;/tt&gt; or
* &lt;tt&gt;SetCellsToSimplify&lt;/tt&gt;. However these methods are mutually exclusive. For example, to simplify 
* a solid, you must define either the faces to be removed or the volumes to be simplified.
* &lt;li&gt;To enhance performance, it is strongly recommended to use the &lt;tt&gt;SetCellsToSimplify&lt;/tt&gt; 
* method, if you want to simplify only some cells and not the whole body.
*&lt;/ul&gt;
