 *&lt;br /&gt;    For the first association (a), we use the least squares association criterion (without constraints) for the two extracted
 *   surfaces (independently of each other) in case of a prismatic feature of size (wedge), or for the extracted surface in case of
 *   a revolute feature of size (cone).
 *&lt;br /&gt;    The first association with a least squares criterion is to establish either a stable intersection line for the prismatic
 *   feature of size, or a stable axis for the revolute feature of size.
 *&lt;br /&gt;    For the second association (b), we use the least squares association criterion (without constraints). The two lines are
 *   associated independently of each other.
 * @param CATTPSASO_LG_SQ
 *   (LG)(SQ) symbol when translated into string.
 *&lt;br /&gt;    The specification operator is the upper limit of the standard deviation of two-line angular sizes (i.e. the standard
 *   deviation of the set of two-line angular size values).
 *&lt;br /&gt;    The two-line angular size is a local size.
 *&lt;br /&gt;    Two sequential association operations are used to define it.
 *&lt;br /&gt;    a) To associate the real angular features of size with a feature of the same nature.
 *&lt;br /&gt;    b) To associate the extracted lines (coming from intersection of the real angular features of size and the intersection
 *   plane) with two straight lines. 
 *&lt;br /&gt;    For the first association (a), we use the least squares association criterion (without constraints) for the two extracted
 *   surfaces (independently of each other) in case of a prismatic feature of size (wedge), or for the extracted surface in case of
 *   a revolute feature of size (cone).
 *&lt;br /&gt;    The first association with a least squares criterion is to establish either a stable intersection line for the prismatic
 *   feature of size, or a stable axis for the revolute feature of size.
 *&lt;br /&gt;    For the second association (b), we use the least squares association criterion (without constraints). The two lines are
 *   associated independently of each other.
 * @param CATTPSASO_Length
 *   The specification applies to any restricted portion of the considered feature of size.
 * @param CATTPSASO_Angle
 *   The specification applies to any restricted portion of the considered feature of size.
 * @param CATTPSASO_SCS
 *   The specification applies to one or several specific fixed cross sections of the complete feature of size.
 *&lt;br /&gt;    Both the SCS modifier and the cross section identifiers are displayed in the 3D dimension.
 * @param CATTPSASO_SCSndId
 *   The specification applies to one or several specific fixed cross sections of the complete feature of size.
 *&lt;br /&gt;    Only the SCS modifier is displayed the 3D dimension. The cross section identifiers are not displayed
 *   in the 3D dimension.
 * @param CATTPSASO_SCSnd
 *   The specification applies to one or several specific fixed cross sections of the complete feature of size.
 *&lt;br /&gt;    The SCS modifier and the cross section identifiers are not displayed in the 3D dimension.
